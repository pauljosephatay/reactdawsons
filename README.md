-	This app is for configuring drive functions as well as seating functions of a power chair.
-	Built using material ui components.
-	Main components are login/logout component, drive functions and seating functions. The user can activate a drive function from the presets or from the user custom setting drives. The activated drive will be displayed on the home screen. The seating functions are simple toggles. All settings are kept in the redux store and the state remains as the user navigates through out the application.
